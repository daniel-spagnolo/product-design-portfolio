						<p class="no-padding-btm">The current year on year growth of job seeker registrations and CV uploads had dropped 15% on the reed.co.uk website. Data analysis showed that there had been a major uplift in traffic from mobile and tablet devices in the last year, but this traffic was not converting into as many registrations and CV uploads as desired. Within three sprints we were given the challenge of:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Lifting registration conversion levels (with an emphasis on mobile and tablet) to ensure continued year on year growth</li>
							<li>Finding out why CV uploads on mobile and tablet were so low</li>

					</div>

					<div>
						<p class="no-padding-btm">As I was new to the job seeker channel I wanted to understand who our current audience was and who I would be designing for. To kickstart this understanding I decided to do two things:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Review the two job seeker personas that had recently been created and see if there was anything else that needed validating about them</li>
							<li>Run a persona empathy mapping workshop with the current job seeker scrum team and stakeholders</li>
						</ol>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Persona review</h3>
						<p>The previous UX designer on the job seeker scrum team had just finished putting together two personas from her research and user interviews and so to get that deeper understanding of the job seeker I started reading and listening back through user interviews and usability sessions. This helped me understand the goals, motivations, frustrations, and current behaviours of job seekers so I could better design solutions that would meet their needs.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Empathy mapping</h3>
						<p class="no-padding-btm">I was inspired to run this empathy mapping workshop by a Cooper article I had just finished reading and I thought it would be a great exercise to run with both the job seeker scrum team and some stakeholders. There were two main aims I had in mind for this workshop:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>So I could get a quick crash course into who the team thought the customers were (as they had been working closer to the product than I had been)</li>
							<li>To focus the team on the “why” behind customer actions, choices, and decisions as they went through the registration journey</li>

							<li>Chunking registration process into easier to process parts for customers</li>
							<li>Conversational, friendly, welcoming, and easy to understand copy throughout</li>

					</div>

					<div>
						<p>It was at this stage in the project that we discovered a great tool called Hotjar, which records user sessions on any page of a website. So, being curious individuals, we quickly went about installing it on the registration page urls so we could start recording job seekers as they went through the registration process.</p>
						<p class="italic">Sidenote: Hotjar is a great tool to see what customers are doing on the site (clicks, taps, mouse movements, etc), but what it can’t tell you is the why of user behaviours. This is where finding issues in Hotjar is a first step and then following up the why with usability sessions and interviews.</p>
						<p>After we got the first lot of recordings (just over 3000 sessions from one night) we divided the recordings up between the team to go over them. From this analysis we discovered some common issues that continually popped up.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Insights</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>A lot of users would actually scroll through the form first to see how long it was</li>
								<li>There was quite a bit of user hesitation when error validation fired while still typing</li>
								<li>A lot of the users would type more than one job title in the “Desired job title” field</li>
								<li>A lot of users also hesitated and took longer than expected to actually fill in the “Desired job title” and “Preferred work location” fields</li>
								<li>You could almost physically feel the pain of users as they tried to figure out which job sector(s) to place themself in</li>

						<p>My next step was to talk to some of the customer service staff as I wanted an understanding of any recurring job seeker registration issues. I always find these customer service catchups really interesting as it’s a great way to quickly get up to speed on day-to-day customer concerns.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Uploading CV’s with cloud services we offer is a frustrating process - customers either don’t use the services offered or they don’t know how to use cloud storage</li>
								<li>Some job seekers have never needed a CV for their industry eg. courier drivers just need certification and a licence. So why is it compulsory to upload a CV to apply for these roles?</li>
								<li>Customers don’t fit into any of our sectors or we don’t have the sector they work in</li>
								<li>Confusion around “Desired job title” registration field - customers were unsure what this meant and why they could only put one job in?</li>
							</ul>
						<p>This chat shone some light on the issues that job seekers had with both the registration process and the CV upload part of it and helped me build even more of an awareness for job seeker concerns.</p>

						<h2 class="no-padding-top">Recognition over recall</h2>
							<div class="horizontal-line-small"></div>
					</div>

					<div>
						<p>A powerful way that I knew we could help job seekers was to leverage recognition over recall. We could personalise and gently guide the user with past behavioural data, such as performing a job search or applying for a role from their signed out journey, and this data could then be used to provide a feed-forward suggestion prompt on necessary fields in the registration process.</p>
						<p>Behaviour data we could use from users searching / applying for jobs:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Job role(s)</li>
								<li>Sector(s)</li>
								<li>Location(s)</li>
								<li>Role type(s) eg. permanent, contract, temporary, graduate</li>
							</ol>
						<p>We decided to run an A/B test with a single suggestion prompt on each of the two registration fields that were having the most time spent on them - "Desired job title" and "Preferred work location". Our hypothesis was that a relevant suggestion would help users recognise a searched location and/or job, instead of trying to recall from memory, and this would aid in reduction of friction on these fields.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Suggestion prompt logic</h3>
						<p>The question that then arose was: What single suggestion would we show to the user when there were multiple pieces of data available? For instance, if the user had done individual searches for three different job roles then we could only show one of the three different job roles. So which bit of data was of more relevance?</p>

						<p>As a team we talked about all possible ways we could collect user behavioural data and decided on which options were the most feasable to do at this stage. I then mapped out the logic flow of these options and which we would use to surface a suggestion for the user.</p>

					</div>

					<div>
						<p>One of my favourite books is Dan Saffer’s Microinteractions, and I try to make sure I incorporate his four parts of a microinteraction laid out in that book (trigger, rules, feedback, and loops) every time I design an interaction such as this. The particular user goal of this microinteraction was to ease user recall and choice based on previous job search / application behaviour.</p>

						<h3>The trigger</h3>
						<p>A clickable tag that contains the suggestion copy and a signifier icon that represents an “add this suggestion to the field” action. The user should be aware that this suggestion text will be inserted into a particular field if clicked.</p>

						<h3>The rules</h3>
						<h5>Loading of registration form:</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>A suggestion tag will appear under related registration field when a new user has:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Searched with keyword(s) eg. job title and / or location</li>
									<li>Viewed a role and clicked apply</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Only one suggestion tag will appear under the related field at a time</li>
							<li>If copy for suggestion tag width is too long then an ellipsis will be used</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>After user adds suggestion to field</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>Clicking the “x” icon on suggestion tag will delete it</li>
							<li>If user clicks or tabs to text field the cursor will appear to the right of suggestion tag</li>
							<li>Hitting the backspace key in text field will delete suggestion tag</li>
							<li>Typing in text field will delete the suggestion tag</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Feedback</h3>
						<p>When the user clicks on the suggestion tag it will smoothly transition from below the field into the related text field. The animation between these two states will help the user understand what has just happened and encourage further use if found elsewhere on the form.</p>

						<h3>Loops</h3>
						<p>To not complicate the interaction I decided no looping would be needed.</p>

					<div>
						<p>One of the main points to come out of the competitor analysis were how other companies were quite open as to why they asked for information and how it would benefit the user. This language was usually quite friendly and conversational without being verbose or hard to understand.</p>
						
						<p>A good example of this friendly aspirational microcopy is how LinkedIn open their registration journey with “Be great at what you do” compared to reed.co.uk’s uninspiring opening of “Join reed.co.uk”.</p>

						<p>Myself and the product owner kicked off this part of the project by running a workshop with Tommy and Ellie from the marketing team to improve the language. Every bit of data that was part of the registration process we asked these questions of:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>What’s the benefit to the business?</li>
								<li>What exactly does the business do with this bit of data?</li>
								<li>What’s the benefit to the job seeker in giving us this information?</li>
								<li>Is there a problem from a user experience point of view?</li>
							</ul>

						<p>After we had gone through and answered these questions we started to begin working out what copy and language we would use to explain benefits and ease any confusion for the job seeker. We felt we did not need to supply a justification for every piece of data (eg. first and last name), but we had to at the very least give the customer the reasons and benefits for providing some data, such as sectors, and completing each section of the form.</p>

					</div>

					<div>
						<p>Another cause of friction was the behaviour of our validation messaging - the validation message would appear the moment a user started typing in a field. On hotjar recordings we could literally see users stop typing...then start...then stop again, as the validation message stayed on. You could almost sense that moment of confusion and/or annoyance, then realisation of what was happening, and then choosing to ignore any other validation messsaging that appeared until they had to submit the form.</p>

					<div>
						<p>While researching validation best practices I found the conclusion of multiple studies was that validation after input helps users to complete forms more quickly and acurately, while premature validation produced longer completion times and worse satisfaction ratings. My initial solution then was to validate after the user had exited the field. It made logical sense and was best UX practice. What I hadn't counted on was technical legacy issues between the backend and the frontend codebase which threw a spanner in the works.</p>

						<h3>Overcoming legacy</h3>
						<p class="no-padding-btm">The legacy issue resulted in the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span class="italic">if</span> validation fired after a user left the field</li>
								<li><span class="italic">and</span> the user clicked back into the field to edit or delete the text</li>
								<li><span class="italic">then</span> the validation message would remain visible until they left the field again</li> 
							</ul>
						<p>I could see that this was going to just replace one confusion with another for the user. There was no way to quickly rectify this legacy issue without some proper development resource, so I had to rethink the solution. In the end I decided to stay with the previous validation behaviour, but delayed the validation to 700 milliseconds after the user had stopped typing. From experimenting with various timings this felt like it allowed the user to still type at a comfortable speed without the validation continually appearing as it did previously.</p>

For these usability sessions I also tested solely on mobile devices as research and qualitative data from actual job seekers using reed.co.uk’s responsive site on mobile was lacking.</p>

						<p>Our frontend developer built the mobile prototype and was able to also connect it to a mirrored live database so that when I was running the sessions the users were able to experience exactly what they would happen on the live site. This really helped with the authenticity of the experience by including site behaviours such as real-time field validation and job search results. I felt that these core site interactions (only achievable with a live browser prototype) were necessary to create the real-life experience that a static click-through prototype would never be able to achieve eg. Entering wrong text in a form field and getting error validation messaging.</p>

						<p class="no-padding-btm">Out of these sessions we also received some valuable mobile behaviour insights which I shared with the whole of the business:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>None of the participants would apply for a job on a mobile</li>
								<li>None of the participants would upload their CV on a mobile</li>
								<li>All of the participants would search for a job on their mobile</li>
								<li>All of the participants would save / shortlist a job on their mobile to apply for later on a desktop / laptop</li>
							</ul>

						<p>Apart from initially setting out to test the registration process we also learned that jobseekers today use their digital devices for different parts of their job search experience - they are all cross device users. All users would search and shortlist jobs on their mobile, but when it came time to apply they would switch to their desktop / laptop device. This allowed them to edit and upload cover letters and CV’s on their desktop / laptop device where it is easier to edit documents.</p>

						<p>My final recommendation to the business based on these findings were to create a customer journey map to better understand the job seekers journey across reed.co.uk's various touchpoints and beyond. Once this had been done we would be able to design and make better decisions based on a deeper knowledge of our users behaviours and attitudes.</p>

						<p>All in all these were very simple changes that we ended up making. By reducing friction, clarifying language, and concentrating on the small details we made a smoother registration experience for users and helped registration conversions start growing again. This is what I truly believe user experience is - being able to pay attention to the simple details, while also keeping in mind the overarching bigger picture, so users have a great product experience.</p>

					<div>
						<p>From the usability sessions I conducted the business received huge insight into the job seeker registration and CV upload behaviour between mobile and desktop devices. With (glorious) hindsight I wish I had done the usability testing at the beginning of the project as this would have uncovered a lot of these deeper issues that were at play sooner.</p>

						<p>From my research we also found that the sector selection was a major friction point for a lot of users (an average of five minutes being spent on this part alone!), but as the business relied extensively on this information to send job recommendations and emails to job seekers there was high-level reluctance to making any changes. Maybe if I had pushed harder (or been able to sway an influential stakeholder) this could have been an issue to prioritise, but as with any big changes to an important part of a business, I didn’t feel I had the support to do this.</p>

						<p>Something I was proud of was aligning design decisions with my two simple design principles throughout the project. Though it is easy to forget about principles during the life of a project, I made a concerted effort to use these to guide my design decisions. These practical and actionable principles really helped in providing appropriate solutions and rationale for design decisions to stakeholders throughout the project.</p>

						<p>All in all this project was not just about changes that helped mobile and tablet users (as originally asked for by the business), but changes that helped all users no matter which device they chose to use - always a win-win for both the business and the users.</p>
