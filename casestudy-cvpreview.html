            <p>Recruiters regularly raised the frustration of never having enough information initially about candidates to be able to make a decision on whether to access their CV and contact information. Importantly, recruiters expressed trust concerns towards reed.co.uk, with being made to use credits without having enough information to inform their decision.</p>

            <p>We needed a way to present more relevant information about candidates that would make the decision making process easier to judge position suitability and also improve customer trust.</p>

Not only does this feature build customer trust, but the extra information provided allows them to quickly make more informed decisions on whether candidates are suitable to pursue.</p>

          <div>
            <p>I came into this project at the point where there had already been discussions between the product owner and stakeholders on the solution for this problem – it felt to me that I had just been brought in to “UX” it (read: make our solution user friendly). A part of this pre-defined “solutionising” was that some stakeholders knew a few of our competitors had various CV preview functions in place and all we had to do was choose one of them to imitate...easy! (cue congratulatory backslapping*).</p>

            <p>I knew that before this was pulled into a two week sprint I really needed to have an understanding of the target users we were designing for, and understand the problem space a little better. After discussing these concerns with the product owner, I was allowed an extra week to do what I thought was needed to gain this understanding. This really felt like a great win for me, and so I quickly started to plan out how I would use this week.</p>

            <p>I decided to break the week into two streams of discovery. The first would be to access all the previous research and user-related data I could lay my hands on; and the second would be to run a design workshop to understand how other stakeholders within reed.co.uk would solve this challenge together.</p>

            <p>The audience I was designing for was the first thing I wanted to get a grasp on. This way I at least could base design decisions on real user goals and motivations.</p>

            <p>There had been four individual recruiter personas created twelve months before – an office manager, two recruitment consultants (one for a small agency and the other for a boutique agency) and an in-house HR professional; but only the boutique agency recruitment consultant persona actually made use of the CV Search product. This lead to discussions with the product owner and the UX lead about who we should be designing this particular feature for and why? From these conversations, we worked out that we had three persona types who do use CV Search and then, which would be our primary persona.</p>

              <p>The in-house recruiter became our focal point as this was the type of recruiter the business  wanted to see use more of CV Search. Our hypothesis was that if we could deliver value to this persona type, then we were also delivering value to the other two persona types. There were some views that maybe the recruitment consultant should be our primary focus, but it was decided that they are usually so specialised in particular sectors (eg. financial recruiters only specialise in finance positions) that trying to provide information for every type of specialist recruiter was outside the scope of this project.</p>


              <h3>Give the people what they want</h3>

              <p>My next step was to flesh out these personas with some good old fashioned grunt work (or desk research as some refer to it as). I started with pouring over user feedback logs to really get my head around what user frustrations (and good things!) there were about the CV Search product in general. Four recurring issues that I took away from the feedback were:</p>


              <ol class="padding-btm">
                <li>Not enough information provided on candidates</li>
                <li>No way to easily compare multiple candidates</li>
                <li>Not knowing if candidate matches were accurate</li>
                <li>No way to know if a candidate is available now (or when they will be next available)</li>
              </ol>


              <p>Issues one and two validated the problem that had lead to this project initially, but it also gave me some confidence in the actual project – knowing we were solving a problem our users actually had, not just throwing in a “me too” feature that a few competitors had. Issues 3 and 4 I put forward as a recommendations to pursue later as they could not be solved in this two week sprint.</p>


              <p>I also looked through past surveys that touched on what information was crucial to recruiters when deciding candidate suitability. Being able to map out the hierarchy of information importance based on these survey responses was an important step in understanding the internal filter process that most recruiters went through when searching for candidates, and this insight would shape the preview features design and layout.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Since I had limited time, and couldn’t talk to all the people in the business during one week, I decided to run two sketching workshops with stakeholders from product, tech, sales, marketing, HR and customer support. I’d used the design studio method previously and decided this would be a great way to get buy-in quickly from people within the business, get some cross-functional collaboration happening, and generate some ideas in a short space of time...oh...and who doesn’t like a good sketch – seriously?</p>

            <p>I presented to the groups a persona scenario with the problems needed to be solved. I also reminded them at intervals throughout the workshop, to remember they were not designing for themselves, but for our persona, to help build a sense of empathy.</p>

          <p>By the end of these two workshops, we had so many great ideas that myself and the product owner had to prioritise a lot of the ideas using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method?oldformat=true" target="blank" class="link">MoSCoW</a> method for future reference and also had great ideas we could move forward with in the current project.</p>

          <p>Ideas we would explore from the design workshops included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Highlighting of searched keywords in a CV snippet</li>
              <li>Sectors that a candidate had applied to recently</li>

          <p>As I was reviewing these sites, it also started me thinking about the interaction patterns we could use. After some research of common patterns it came down to three options:</p>

                  <h5>1. A modal pop-up</h5>
                  <p>Our interface could not justify a CV modal popping up on a hover, like the Indeed interaction, as it would just cover up information that the user may want to view</p>

                  <h5>2. A click-through to a new screen</h5>
                  <p>I definitely did not want to be adding an extra screen to the user's journey, so that option was out too</p>

                  <h5>3. An unhide more information option</h5>
                  <p>I was certain, even at this stage, that this would be the pattern I would use. This is a common pattern used on Google+, YouTube, and various other popular products so most users would be familiar with it.</p>

          <p>Jobsite used this accordion pattern, but they had the user navigate from the search results screen to the individual candidate's profile screen to use their view more option. It seemed a strange flow to make the user click deeper into a candidate's profile (and move to another screen) to actually view more information – we could do better than that! This was a prime example of where <span class="italic">adapting</span>, not just adopting, an existing pattern for our particular problem was the way to go.</p>

 <!-- Mapping out a system (Generic module) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ -->

          </div>

          <div>

            <p>Understanding the data interplay between the jobseeker and recruiter sides of the system was something I needed to clarify my thinking during the design process. I always prefer to have more than just a surface level overview of any system I work with, so I’m confident I’m designing the best solution.</p>

              <p>Questions that I felt needed investigating were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>What individual pieces of data do we collect from jobseekers?</li>
                  <li>What data was compulsory and voluntary from the jobseeker?</li>
                  <li>What data is shown to recruiters as summary details?</li>
                  <li>What information was kept behind the credit paywall?</li>
                  <li>How was data played back to recruiters from candidates who had supplied more data than others?</li>
                </ul>

              <p class="padding-top">This lead to some simple sketched mapping of the system on my own and then talking to database and backend developers on the jobseeker and recruiter teams to understand the relationships between the data (and to make sure I had it right of course!).</p>

              <p>This mapping exercise lead to added value. I got the whole scrum team together to understand if there were any other ways of using system data to improve a recruiter's decision on a candidate? Data about a candidate's behaviors on our site was an idea that came out of this discussion and so we decided to implement two pieces of behavioural information into the design – top sectors and top locations that a candidate had applied to in the last six months.</p>

          <p>Early sketching mainly dealt with how the content would be placed and displayed within the accordion slidedown. I grouped related information together and worked through the hierarchical organisation of information based on customer value when researching. This was all done so that it could be easily digested by a busy recruiter who would only have time to quickly scan information.</p>  

          <p>A decision that I made early in this phase was to place the candidate skills within the actual candidate summary card. This was by far the most important piece of information recruiters had said they found useful in research, so starting with this being surfaced right away on the results made sense to me.</p>

                <li>How would the layout change based on this?</li>
                <li>Would we just use empty states where no data was provided?</li>
                <li>Would blocks of content just not appear?</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="padding-top">Without really thinking about the effects of our decision, the product owner and myself made a quick call for blocks of information to just disappear if no data was found. It was felt that half of a preview would look better visually than an expanse of empty states. This snap decision would come back to haunt us later though (yes, hindsight is a wonderful thing).</p>

            <p>During the wireframing process I decided we needed to get some feedback on what we were doing from our customers. Though I prefer to conduct usability testing face-to-face with users, there was too short a time period to organise and set up sessions, so I did the next best thing – email a prototype and some follow-up questions to select users (who said improv is dead?). In this instance we chose seven customers who matched our primary persona type and then emailed them a scenario, an invision prototype link and a short survey for some quick feedback.</p>

            <p>Even though we were not there to ask additional questions while they were using the prototype we were still extremely happy with the positive feedback and took it as a sign that we were on the right track and so I moved onto designing the UI.</p>

          <div>
            <p>The first UI design challenge regarded the style guide... in that there was no style guide. The whole of the recruiter site (which CV Search is a part of) had been put together frankenstein-style over the years by different designers and developers adding their own styling to the site.</p>

            <p>The end result haphazard site was a symptom of a company that did not fully understand the value of having a style guide. To say it was an inconsistent experience would be an understatement: different colours, different patterns, flat design elements mixed with skeuomorphic elements, no font size consistency – basically enough confusion to drive the user, and me, crazy. Working like this added a lot of time to the UI design, as I had about three or four different styles to choose from for every element I wanted to use. Doing up a style guide was beyond the scope of this project, but that didn’t mean I could not start creating one with the elements I decided to use.</p>

Upon seeing this addition to the summary card though the product owner was of the opinion that it used too much screen real estate and, despite my objections, it was decided to transfer the skills into the accordion preview and remove the headings and icons.</p>

            <p>How much to show of a candidate's CV in the CV snippet part of the preview also presented  some design challenges. We had to show enough of the CV context so the recruiter could gain an understanding of how a CV snippet related to their searched keyword; but presenting this information in a way that didn’t show too much of the CV or any candidate contact information. After some experimentation within the browser, we decided on the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>We would only show ten words before and twenty words after the searched keyword as I felt this was the right balance to achieve some context around the snippet</li>
              <li>We’d show a maximum of three CV snippets as this still provided CV insight for the recruiter</li>
              <li>We’d block out phone numbers and emails that showed in the snippet</li>

          <div>
            <p>The placement and styling of the preview button brought team members and stakeholders subjective design opinion to the fore, and I spent countless days listening to an avalanche of subjective points of view. There were debates about the position and sizing of the button, the button colour, the button copy and should the preview button actually just be a preview link?</p>

            <p>To not get bogged down in subjective nonsense, I did some hallway testing of different versions to see which would be the most easily understood concept. From this feedback I found that:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A full width button at the bottom “just flowed” better</li>
              <li>View profile copy was more easily understood as to what would happen next</li>

          <div>
            <p>Before completing the UI design an opportunity arose to be able to run a usability session with some of our internal HR recruiters that afternoon. The front end developer and myself decided we could get a “dirty” prototype happening in the browser to quickly get something usable in front of them. For the next few hours we worked together on the prototype and how the preview accordion would animate. An idea I wanted to try was to have the preview panel scroll automatically to the top of the screen when opened as I thought this would enable the user to focus solely on the preview information. One of the shortcomings of this prototype though was that we only included candidate dummy data, meaning that the prototyped accordion previews did not show any missing content (as would happen with actual live data).</p>

          <div>
            <p>That afternoon, feeling very proud of ourselves, we put the prototype in front of the internal HR recruiters. The main questions we wanted answered were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Was it any easier to make a credit spend decision based upon the extra preview information now available?</li>
              <li>Was there any information that they felt was still missing?</li>
              <li>Was it easy to scan information and language used understandable?</li>
              <li>Was there enough context around the CV snippets?</li>
            </ul>   

            <p class="padding-top">The main issues to come out of these sessions were that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The automatic scroll to the top of screen of the preview panel was disorientating and all users still wanted to scroll up some more to view the candidates summary information</li>
              <li>They were unsure if the “View profile” preview button copy meant show more of the work history information above it</li>
              <li>There was no relocation or availability information on the candidate</li>

            <p>Before the launch of the feature, we wanted to make sure the auto scrolling and button copy issues from the usability sessions were given some attention.</p>

              <h4>Issue 1: Automatic scrolling on preview</h4>
              <p>We changed the scrolling from stopping at the preview panel to stopping at the top of the candidates summary card</p> 

              <h4>Issue 2: Preview button copy</h4>
              <p>We changed the preview button copy to “Preview profile” as we felt recruiters knew that profile was referring to candidate profiles and preview was the action that would take place.</p> 

              <h4>Issue 3: Missing data</h4>
              <p>The relocation and availability data issues were something we could not include, as we did not collect these particular data points from candidates; so this insight was passed onto the jobseeker product owner for review.</p>

            <p>One of the traits I pride myself on as a designer is being able to bring a particular quality to everything I design, be it deep diving into solving the actual needs of the customer, or working to improve those little micro-interactions that no-one else notices. I feel that this aspect was missing from parts of this project and that the business’ first priority was to get something, anything, out live as quickly as possible. Don’t get me wrong, this thinking is fine if you are going down the lean MVP route and continually iterating on learnings and feedback, but that was never the case here.</p>

              <p>I am proud of convincing the product owner (who obviously must be a very understanding human being) that I needed some upfront research time to understand the customer's problem better. This felt like a small win to educate the business in how UX and research can produce an effective solution that works for both them and the customer… though I still feel that some of the insights that actually came out of my research, such as collecting candidate information around relocation and availability, could have been incorporated into this project. If there had been more of a real focus on delivering what our customer needed, rather than on just quickly releasing an “us too” feature, we could have really built a feature that actually helped the majority of our customers make better candidate decisions.</p>

              <p>In the end though I’ve realised that this feature still helped a lot of the in-house recruiters that we were aiming it at, so in that regard it was still a valuable feature that I hope improved their experience with the product and made what is a tough job a bit easier.</p>
