						<p>Users of Onfido’s applicant form were unaware of identity documentation requirements that would allow them to be verified successfully on the first attempt. This meant applications needed to be “re-opened” (with users having to re-upload documentation again) if these requirements were not met, which slowed down the time it took clients to receive verification results.</p>

From our data we could see that the document upload step in the form had a drop-off rate of ~25% (slightly larger on mobile) so improving this part of the form would provide the most value to both applicants and the business. To measure the success of this project we set ourselves the following success metrics:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Decrease document step drop off rate by 10%</li>
							<li>Decrease application re-open rate (due to incorrect documents being provided) by 10%</li>

						<p>Using a combination of desk research, who our applicant form clients were and who were their users, and speaking to internal stakeholders it became clear that most applicants were applying for jobs in the on-demand service economy eg. ride-sharing drivers, food delivery riders, cleaners, handymen, etc. These applicants could be UK migrants applying for their first job, people looking to supplement their income with a second job, or full time gig economy workers. With these insights we put together our primary proto-persona called Marco &mdash; a recent migrant to the UK from Italy, with basic English skills, currently using his old iPhone to access the web, and looking for part-time work as a stop-gap measure until he can get a full-time job. We did have two other personas, but I didn't have the time to flesh these out with more research — though I made sure to keep them in mind when designing.</p>

						<p>Onfido offers various identity checks to companies, who then pick and choose which of these checks they wanted to run on applicants. Each of these individual checks have their own regulatory rules to follow (eg. what documents are allowed), but once checks are combined with other checks then these rules start to overlap and the complexity headache begins.</p>

						<p class="no-padding-btm">Some of the things we needed to think about when combining different checks were:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Which check takes a higher priority over other checks?</li>
							<li>What happens if a document supplied covers other check requirements?</li>
							<li>Is an additional document now needed to complete regulation requirements?</li>

							<li>How do we make our solution scalable and easy to maintain for future regulation changes?</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>The major challenge in this project was to not expose these underlying complexities and regulatory constraints to the user. All of this behind the scenes logic had to be streamlined in the backend so only what the user needed to know was shown to them in the interface.</p>

						<p>Due to regulation some documents types (like birth certificate) required supporting documentation to reach a level of identification accuracy. In the existing form when a user chose a primary document (that required support documentation) these support documents were added to the next list of document options – without the user being aware that these new list additions were related to their <span class="italic">primary</span> previous document selection!</p>

						<p>We made this whole <span class="italic">primary plus support document</span> process into an easy to follow flow that showed upfront when support documentation would be needed. This allowed the user to see exactly how their primary document selection could lead to more documents to upload — no nasty surprises or confusion. After doing some quick user testing of two flows we chose to go with the flow that best supported users mental model of choosing and uploading a primary plus support document.</p>

						<p>Most people aren't the best photographers so getting them to take a picture of a document comes with the possibility that important information may be missing eg. parts of documents out of frame, glare that makes a number unreadable, a finger partly covering numbers etc. Onfido used machine learning to read information off of documents and so missing information was something we wanted to eradicate as much as possible from supplied images.</p>
						
						<p>Going through our data for each document type we were able to see the main reasons for photo quality failure. Using these insights we were able to present to the applicant helpful tips and advice on how to take the best picture regarding the document they were about to upload. </p>

						<p>Being in an environment with real end-users of the product was a great learning experience for me. A lot of the riders spend the whole day going through rider training, information sessions, and filling in online forms which can easily become a stressful situation, especially if you really need this job to earn money. Seeing this firsthand made me appreciate that a lot of our users come to our product already stressed and so we needed to provide an experience that was as simple and stress-free as possible.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Usability insights</h3>
						<p>The main issues to come from the testing were then shared with the rest of the team and we prioritised the top five issues that needed addressing for the first release.</p>

						<h5>Issue 1: User confusion</h5>
						<p>Ability to change a document on the document upload card (after a document had been uploaded) caused hesitation and confusion for users as we now had an "edit" button and a "change" button. We decided once a user had uploaded a document successfully we would replace the “Change document” button with a success tick. This meant that the user now would be less confused with a “Change” and an “edit” button being displayed at the same time.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>After the user had uploaded a document we showed an animation to let them know it had successfully uploaded and been saved.</li>
							<li>We replaced the “Change document” button with a success tick after a document had successfully uploaded <span class="italic">(as above)</span> &mdash; meaning the user could see at any time that this document had successfully uploaded even if they had been distracted and missed the upload success animation.</li>

						<p class="no-padding-btm">Some clients required other documentation (besides the ones needed for checks) to be uploaded. To allow for this we had included an "Add another document" link to the screen, but this option was confusing users (some were just clicking it to see what happened!). Adding an “optional” tag to the module and also adding some microcopy underneath advising applicant they would have been informed if other documents needed we thought would be a solution to this.</p>

Instead of having generic options like “Government letter” or “Utility bill” which were ambiguous to users, we broke these options into the exact documents allowed eg. “Utility bill” option was broken into options of “Electricity bill”, “Gas bill”, and “Water bill”.</p>

						<p>Early on in the project I learnt a valuable lesson in becoming fixated on one idea too early. I feel if I’d involved the team a little earlier in my exploration of the question and answer format I would have not have wasted a few days exploring and sketching this solution. A great reminder to show my work and thinking earlier, even if I’m not comfortable with it.</p>

						<p>I also had a nagging doubt in the back of my head throughout the project of my understanding of the actual users. It wasn’t until I spent a day user testing at Deliveroo that I finally felt I had a proper understanding and empathy with the real users. I wish I had had the chance in the research phase to talk to actual users rather than just relying on previous company research. I learnt so much in that one day about how an applicant could be stressed or tired when using the applicant form.</p>

						<p>Overall I felt this project really succeeded in making a positive impact on how people within Onfido thought about design. Everyone knew that this document step needed big improvements, but there were so many different solutions coming from different people that being able to bring a focus was needed &mdash; and a design process helped to bring this focus to find a solution in a collaborative and non-subjective way. It was great to hear from members of the sales team later that it was so much easier to pitch the Applicant form to clients when they had a great looking and usable product that they were confident in.</p>
